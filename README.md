## The Thought Archive

Welcome to **The Thought Archive** — _Echoes of learning, stitched together._

This is a living collection of ideas gathered from my explorations in education, faith, psychology, technology, crafts, and games. Each note is a thread in an ever-growing tapestry of thought — connected, revisited, and refined over time. Here, curiosity leads the way, and knowledge becomes something woven rather than stored.

Wander through, follow the threads, and see where the echoes lead.

That’s a really insightful question — and you’re already thinking about your vault like someone who wants it to _grow with you_, which is exactly how the Johnny.Decimal system works best.

Let’s break down your points and the “formal vs. independent” question a bit, then I’ll outline what your **21–29 Education & Career** area could look like.

### 🎓 **Formal vs. Independent Learning — what’s the difference?**

It really depends on _how you think_ and _how you plan to use your notes_ later:

|Approach|Pros|When it helps|
|---|---|---|
|**Separate them** (e.g. “21 Formal Education” and “22 Independent Learning”)|Keeps class-related material tidy and distinct from your general curiosity. Helps you find coursework or academic notes quickly.|If you expect to take more classes later, or if you like your “research rabbit holes” to stay cleanly organized.|
|**Combine them** (just “21 Learning & Research”)|Reflects how you _actually_ learn — self-guided, interconnected, and curiosity-based.|If you see learning as one big ecosystem, where schoolwork, personal research, and reading all feed into your growth.|

From what you’ve said — enjoying self-paced learning and connecting different topics — it sounds like _combining_ them might feel more natural for now. You can always split them later if it gets too full.

### 💡 Based on what you’ve shared

Your **Education & Career** area seems to serve three big purposes:

1. **Learning:** where your curiosity lives — notes, summaries, references.
    
2. **Career exploration:** figuring out where God might be calling you professionally.
    
3. **Teaching & skill-building:** gathering tools, methods, and reflections on how you teach and help others learn.
