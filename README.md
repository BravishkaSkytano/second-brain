## The Thought Archive

Welcome to **The Thought Archive** — _Echoes of learning, stitched together._

This is a living collection of ideas gathered from my explorations in education, faith, psychology, technology, crafts, and games. Each note is a thread in an ever-growing tapestry of thought — connected, revisited, and refined over time. Here, curiosity leads the way, and knowledge becomes something woven rather than stored.

Wander through, follow the threads, and see where the echoes lead.
