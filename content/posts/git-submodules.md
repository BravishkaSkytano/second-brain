As the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) states, "Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate." Essentially, it's a repo inside another repo.

I like to use submodules for site themes and my content folders, it keeps everything in one place and allows me to focus on one specific thing at a time. It also helps me narrow down issues with site builds, because it's much easier to tell if the problem was a site configuration issue, a content issue, or a theme issue when I've only touched one of them.

If you want to learn more about submodules and how to use them, I recommend [this article by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-git-submodules/), they're a great resource for coders and learners.
