## Overview

> Rococo, less commonly Roccoco ( rə-KOH-koh, US also ROH-kə-KOH; French: [ʁɔkɔko] or [ʁokoko] ), also known as Late Baroque, is an exceptionally ornamental and dramatic style of architecture, art, and decoration which combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colours, sculpted moulding, and trompe-l'œil frescoes to create surprise and the illusion of motion and drama. It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement.
> 
> Originally known as the “style Rocaille," Rococo began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Louis XIV style. It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia. It also came to influence other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware, glassware, painting, music, theatre, and literature. Although originally a secular style primarily used for interiors of private residences, the Rococo had a spiritual aspect to it which led to its widespread use in church interiors, particularly in Central Europe, Portugal, and South America.
