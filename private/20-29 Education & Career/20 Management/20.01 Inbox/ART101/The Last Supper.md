*The Last Supper* is a renowned mural painting created between 1495 and 1498 and located in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It depicts the moment when Jesus announces that one of his apostles will betray him, capturing the reactions of the twelve apostles with emotional depth and complexity. The painting is notable for its innovative use of perspective, chiaroscuro, and its historical significance in the transition to the [[High Renaissance]]. Despite its original condition deteriorating over time due to environmental factors and restoration attempts, it remains one of the most celebrated works of art in the Western world.
