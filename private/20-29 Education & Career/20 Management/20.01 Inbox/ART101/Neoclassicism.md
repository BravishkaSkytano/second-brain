^tldr

Neoclassicism was a cultural movement that emerged in the 18th century, drawing inspiration from the art and culture of [[Classical|classical]] antiquity, and it influenced various fields such as architecture, visual arts, literature, and music. It originated in Rome and spread across Europe as artists and scholars returned from the Grand Tour with newfound appreciation for Greco-Roman ideals. The movement coincided with the Age of Enlightenment and competed with Romanticism, enduring into the 19th and 20th centuries. In architecture, Neoclassicism emphasized simplicity, symmetry, and the use of classical motifs, while in the visual arts, it often focused on historical and mythological subjects. The style also had a significant impact on fashion, music, and decorative arts, and it experienced revivals in various forms throughout history, including in totalitarian regimes and postmodern architecture.
