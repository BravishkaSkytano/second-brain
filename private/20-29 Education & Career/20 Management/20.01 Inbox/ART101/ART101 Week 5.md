- [[W5 Worksheet]]

Use Google to complete the following worksheet and become familiar with the material.  There will be a quiz that is due by the end of the week. 

**Field Trip**

Each student must attend one field trip to a classical musical concert, opera, ballet, ethic dance ensemble, play, musical, or other approved outing.  Each student must write a 200 word report discussing the art you experienced and discuss the works intelligently using terms and concepts learned in class along with your own responses (positive or negative) to the works. 

**Week 5 Discussion Board:**

We learned about the Pantheon in Week 1. Since it has been coming up in my studies and even through social media I think it warrants a discussion topic.  
  
Write about an example of technology being used in art or art being used in technology.  
  
One example of how art is being used to inspire technology is how the roof of the new Falcons Football Stadium in Atlanta is inspired by the Oculus in the Pantheon. [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Lujl76FJlCA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Lujl76FJlCA)  
  
Another example of how technology is being used in art is how scientists have created self-healing concrete by using a special kind of bacteria. It is living art in a sense.  
  
In a book called Stuff Matters by Mark Miyodownik, he writes:  
The existence of concrete feeds the ambition of engineers. Once the Romans had invented it, they realized that it would allow them to build the infrastructure of their empire. It allowed them to build ports wherever they wanted, because their concrete could set under water. They could build aqueducts and bridges, too—the very infrastructure needed to transport the raw ingredients for concrete to wherever they were needed, instead of relying on local stone or clay.  
In this sense, concrete is ideally suited to empire building. The most impressive piece of Roman concrete engineering, however, is in its capital: the dome of the Pantheon in Rome. Still standing today, it is two thousand years old but still the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world... This mechanization of the process of building is what makes concrete such a modern material. It lends itself to pouring and molding, to the rapid building of vast structures. The big structures of old, such as the stone cathedrals of Europe or the Great Wall of China, took decades to build. The central core of the Shard, one of the tallest buildings in Europe, took less than six months. The material enables you to think big, to dream. It is the material that has allowed the ambition of civil engineers to be realized. The Hoover Dam is built from reinforced concrete, as are the Millau Viaduct and Spaghetti Junction. Given that literally half of the world’s structures are made from concrete, the upkeep of concrete structures represents a huge and growing effort. To make matters more difficult, many of these structures are in environments that we don’t want to have to revisit on a regular basis, such as the Øresund Bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark, or the inner core of a nuclear power station. In these situations it would be ideal to find a way to allow concrete to look after itself, to engineer concrete to be self-healing.  
Such a concrete does now exist, and although it is in its infancy it has already been shown to work. The story of these self-healing concretes started when scientists began to investigate the types of life forms that can survive extreme conditions. They found a type of bacterium that lives in the bottom of highly alkaline lakes formed by volcanic activity. These lakes have pH values of between 9 and 11, which will cause burns to human skin. Previously it had been thought, not unreasonably, that no life could exist in these sulfurous ponds. But careful study revealed life to be much more tenacious than we thought. Alkaliphilic bacteria were found to be able to survive in these conditions. And it was discovered that one particular type called B. pasteurii could excrete the mineral calcite, a constituent of concrete. These bacteria were also found to be extremely tough and able to survive dormant, encased in rock, for decades. Self-healing concrete has these bacteria embedded inside it along with a form of starch, which acts as food for the bacteria. Under normal circumstances these bacteria remain dormant, encased by the calcium silicate hydrate fibrils. But if a crack forms, the bacteria are released from their bonds, and in the presence of water they wake up and start to look around for food. They find the starch that has been added to the concrete, and this allows them to grow and replicate. In the process they excrete calcite, a form of calcium carbonate. This calcite bonds to the concrete and starts to build up a mineral structure that spans the crack, stopping further growth of the crack and sealing it up. It’s the sort of idea that might sound good in theory but never work in practice. But it does work. Research now shows that cracked concrete that has been prepared in this way can recover 90 percent of its strength thanks to these bacteria. This self-healing concrete is now being developed for use in real engineering structures."

*As a part of your grade, be sure to make one original post by Wednesday of each week and respond to at least two of your classmate's posts by the end of each week.
