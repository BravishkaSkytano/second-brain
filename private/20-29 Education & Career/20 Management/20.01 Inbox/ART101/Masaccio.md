Masaccio, born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was a pioneering [[Florence|Florentine]] painter of the early Italian [[Renaissance]], renowned for his naturalistic style and use of linear perspective. He is best known for his work on the Brancacci Chapel [[Fresco|frescoes]], which showcase his mastery of chiaroscuro and three-dimensional forms, significantly influencing later artists like [[Michelangelo]]. Despite his short career, Masaccio's innovations in painting marked the beginning of the Early Italian Renaissance, moving art away from the International [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style toward a more realistic and humanistic approach. His legacy is preserved through surviving works such as the *Holy Trinity* fresco and the *Expulsion from the Garden of Eden*.
