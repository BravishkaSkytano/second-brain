>[!bible] [[Daniel 8#8|Daniel 8:8]]
<sup><b>8</b></sup> Thus the goat became very great, but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off, and four prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven. 

The four horns represented the four kingdoms of the Diadochi:
1. [[Macedonia]] and [[Greece]], ruled by [[Cassander]]
2. [[Thrace]], [[Bithynia]], and most of [[Asia Minor]], ruled by [[Lysimachus]]
3. [[Syria]], [[Babylon]] and the rest of the east, ruled by [[Seleucus]]
4. [[Egypt]] and possibly [[Palestine]] and [[Arabia Petraea]], ruled by [[Ptolemy]]
