- Art Field Trip Report
	- You will prepare a Field Trip Report, on a play, film, or art museum (or gallery). The report should one page (double-spaced) and will contain both objective and subjective information about the art you experienced. Include titles of compositions with their composers, authors, artists, choreographers, etc., and discuss the works intelligently using terms and concepts learned in class along with your own responses (positive or negative) to the works. These may be completed at any time during the semester, but the papers are due by the last day of class.
- Music Field Trip Report
	- You will prepare a Field Trip Report, on a classical musical concert, opera, or ballet (or ethnic dance ensemble). The report should one page (double-spaced) and will contain both objective and subjective information about the art you experienced. Include titles of compositions with their composers, authors, artists, choreographers, etc., and discuss the works intelligently using terms and concepts learned in class along with your own responses (positive or negative) to the works.
