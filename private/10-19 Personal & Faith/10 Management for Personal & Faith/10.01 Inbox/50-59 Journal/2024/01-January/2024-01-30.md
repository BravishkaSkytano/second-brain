- **(08:51)** Woke up, did my devotion. It was on {{< sidenote "Mark 13:33" >}}Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don’t know when the time is.{{< /sidenote >}} on how we need to take care of the possessions God has given us until Jesus returns.
- **(09:54)** I just got back from Dunkin, their Wake Up Pancake is so small lol. Anyway, I walked there and it took me about 12 minutes there and another 12 back. The walk back felt quicker though for some reason. Now, I'm ready to play RuneScape :D
- **(10:00)** Bruh, I can't play RuneScape through Steam on Linux???? Okay.... RuneScape has an official Linux installer though so I guess I just have to install it that way.
- **(11:31)** Instead of playing RuneScape, I watched The Vampire Diaries. This whole Katherine thing is getting annoying.
