Today was okay. We had the March for Life rally again. Of course, we got there late and the whole thing was finished. It was snowing and a little breezy, so we were also cold. Got some nice pics though. We also built Mom's first snowman. She didn't help us assemble it 😆 she just wanted the experience of making a big snowball. We didn't make it to the expo either, the thirty-minute walk was a waste. Now, my body hurts and I have a headache. I need food and water, two things we haven't had much of today.
