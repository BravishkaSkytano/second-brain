> Peace begins with a smile.
> — Mother Teresa

- A lot has happened today and at the same time, not much.
- We didn't go to church, but we attended online. Pastor Brian Pettrey spoke about contentment and how to raise God and lower ourselves. His sermon wasn't bad, guess he's growing on me.
- Malkiya was crying because she was under burnout and didn't know how to fix it, but I offered to help her and she accepted it.
- I found a way to talk to her when she's upset, it seems like if she doesn't visibly see me, or if I'm not staring at her, she speaks for freely.
- I did a whole session speaking about burnout and how to prevent it through organization and mental relaxation. I also found a few supplementary videos.
- Aiden Helfant did a video on Lifestyle Design and it was *amazing!* [Use This Strategy To Craft Your Ideal College Life - YouTube](https://youtu.be/K5wxh4lISgk?si=dgcdU5-6PINFU48r)
