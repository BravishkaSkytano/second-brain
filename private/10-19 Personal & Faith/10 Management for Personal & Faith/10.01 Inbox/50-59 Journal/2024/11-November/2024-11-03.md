- Today is Kieron’s birthday. I texted him, that’s pretty much it.
- We went to Harvest Church and it was okay. The message was on slaying dragons with the Lord’s help.
- Ended up FaceTimeing Kieron, and it was… okay, I guess. I don’t know, the spark isn’t there anymore. It hasn’t been for a while, but I’m really paying attention to it now. He just seems like an annoying older brother, and I really mean *annoying*. I enjoy talking to {{< backlink "joshua-alejandro" "Joshi" >}} more.

### Work Log

- ({{< backlink "APO391" "APO391" >}}) I finished the discussion board for week 2
- ({{< backlink "APO391" "APO391" >}}) I took the reading quiz, think I got every question right.
- ({{< backlink "SOC2110" "SOC2110" >}}) Watched video 8, and it was… wow. The topic was abortion and it was a pretty good argument. The speaker showed a short video going over what a baby looks like after it’s aborted at different stages of growth. It was so sad. Even at the earliest stage, you can see the hands and fingers! How can someone see that and argue the fetus isn’t human?
