> Love doesn't make the world go round, love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
> — Elizabeth Browning

Today, I am grateful for:

1. {{< backlink "joshua-alejandro" "Joshua" >}} for his goofiness and his gift of listening.

### Memos

- I spoke to {{< backlink "joshua-alejandro" "Joshua" >}} about how Mom kinda stole part of my cut of the Roth IRA that Grandma left me. He got pretty upset about it too, however, he was proud of me for being able to express my emotions about the whole thing. I don’t know how he sees it, but he says that I’m stronger than I think I am and I’m not a coward. For some reason, I didn’t cry. Maybe, it’s because I knew Ms. Karen would arrive soon, I don’t know.

### Work Log

- Didn’t get much done, procrastinated for *hours* instead of reading A New Introduction to Islam by Daniel W. Brown.
- Plot twist, I don’t even have to read the book this week! All that’s due is Lecture 2 and an article comparing Christianity and Islam.
