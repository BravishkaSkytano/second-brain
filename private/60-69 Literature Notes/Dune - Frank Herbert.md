## Quotes

:::Frank Herbert, Dune:::
- “I must not fear. [[Fear|Fear]] is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
- “It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.”
- “The mind can go either direction under stress—toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.”
- “Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.”
- “Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things…" she held up four big-knuckled fingers. "…the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these things are as nothing…" She closed her fingers into a fist. "…without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!”
