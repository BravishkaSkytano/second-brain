## Journal

Mood::

Today, I am grateful for:
1. [[Joshua Alejandro|Joshi]] for his goofiness and his gift of listening.

### Memos

- I spoke to [[Joshua Alejandro|Joshua]] about how Mom kinda stole part of my cut of the Roth IRA that Grandma left me. He got pretty upset about it too, however, he was proud of me for being able to express my emotions about the whole thing.
- I don’t know how he sees it, but he says that I’m stronger than I think I am and I’m not a coward. For some reason, I didn’t cry. Maybe, it’s because I knew Ms. Karen would arrive soon, I don’t know.

### Work Log

- Didn’t get much done, procrastinated for *hours* instead of reading [[Daniel W Brown - A New Introduction to Islam|A New Introduction to Islam by Daniel W. Brown]].
- Plot twist, I don’t even have to read the book this week! All that’s due is Lecture 2 and an article comparing Christianity and Islam.
