Sunni Muslims account for 85% of all Muslims, being the largest branch of Islam in the world. They are guided by the *Sunnah* (traditions about Muhammad’s life and teachings) and consider themselves to by the orthodox branch. Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr was rightly chosen as caliph.

Shia Muslims, however, consider Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, as the true successor. This belief deepened after Ali’s son Hussein was killed in 680 during a battle in present-day Iraq. Most Shias believe that Ali was the first of a dynasty of 12 legitimate leaders of the Muslims that vanished from the earth and will return some day.
