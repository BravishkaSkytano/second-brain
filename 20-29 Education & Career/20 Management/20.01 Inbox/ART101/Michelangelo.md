Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, known mononymously as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the [[High Renaissance]]. Born in 1475 in Caprese, he became one of the most influential artists of the 16th century, renowned for works such as the *Pietà*, *David*, and the [[Fresco|frescoes]] on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. His creative abilities and mastery across multiple artistic fields define him as an archetypal [[Renaissance man]], and he left a lasting impact on Western art, influencing movements such as Mannerism. Michelangelo's legacy includes iconic architectural projects like St. Peter's Basilica and a vast body of work that continues to inspire artists and scholars.
