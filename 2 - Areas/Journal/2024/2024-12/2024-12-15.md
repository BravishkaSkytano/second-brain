## Journal

— 10:34 PM —

Today was… exhausting. My feet hurt. My knees hurt. Surprisingly my head no longer hurts. On the bright side, it was my first official day as an usher, and it was great. Lolita is a wonderful lady who loves being an usher, and saying Yo-yo . Unfortunately, I was on my feet for the entire service because I had to run to Dunkin’ Donuts for food so I could take my headache medicine (which I didn’t take), and then Tremaine had to run me through some security measures for upstairs and the meetup rooms for the ministry.
