— 9:54 AM —

I slept horribly. For whatever reason, I had nightmares that included some references from the TV show From. Usually, I can handle that and go back to sleep just fine, but I guess my brain needed a creative writing project to work on because it just didn’t want to stop thinking about horror. Anyway, I’ve been up since about 5:40 and eventually came downstairs to get my laptop so I could work on my [[Final Paper]] for [[APO391 Introduction to Islam]]. Of course, I didn’t get to that because Mom woke up and needed help going to the bathroom. And then she put on the TV and I ended up watching In the Heat of the Night and got up to get breakfast around 8ish. The show is still on though, and I’m struggling to study. I’m tired and I don’t want to go to karate later. This fatigue is not good, now I’m having depressing thoughts and…. idk, a lot is going on and yet nothing at all.
