I slept horribly. For whatever reason, I had nightmares that included some references from the TV show From. Usually, I can handle that and go back to sleep just fine, but I guess my brain needed a creative writing project to work on because it just didn’t want to stop thinking about horror. Anyway, I’ve been up since about 5:40 and eventually came downstairs to get my laptop so I could work on my [[Final Paper|final paper]] for [[APO391 Introduction to Islam|the Islam course]]. Of course, I didn’t get to that because Mom woke up and needed help going to the bathroom. And then she put on the TV and I ended up watching In the Heat of the Night and got up to get breakfast around 8ish. The show is still on though, and I’m struggling to study. I’m tired and I don’t want to go to karate later. This fatigue is not good, now I’m having depressing thoughts and…. idk, a lot is going on and yet nothing at all.

We’re not going to karate. Malkiya is coming down with something and I’m tired. Mom didn’t even ask.

I feel… stressed? I don’t know, like I want to pace and scream and just disappear all at the same time. I’m not even sure why. I got an extension for my paper. Tomorrow is a busy day but it’s not really new, all I have to do is smile and usher people to the right spot and then help out at God’s Own. Yes, we have to help the kids with their play, but it’s not like it’s a super big event. And yet… I feel so… overwhelmed. I want to be with [[Joshua Alejandro|Joshua]], but I can’t. I wish school was finished, but it isn’t. Mom won’t let me be. My emotions won’t lay off. I can’t even speak to God anymore. Everything is falling apart *again*. I just want to live my life in a way that isn’t so… overwhelming or draining or someone else’s script.

I just noticed what the quote for today said. Kind of ironic, no? I can’t change what’s happened, but I can change how I view it all and what I’m going to do about it. I need to remember that and focus on it more.
