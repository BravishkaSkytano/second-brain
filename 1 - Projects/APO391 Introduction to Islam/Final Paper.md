## Introduction

When most of us think of philosophy, we picture people like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Kant, Confucius, Sun Tzu, Voltaire, and Locke. If you look up a list of famous philosophers, you will see many more Greeks, Europeans, and Chinese men who have made great contributions to the subject. Interestingly enough, one group of highly-populated people who you will not see on many lists happen to be the Muslims. Ask someone to name one Muslim philosopher and only the most studious of philosophers *might* mention Averroes, a Muslim born in Spain and known for his commentaries on Aristotle. Every major religion has their great philosophers, so where are the Muslim ones? That, my friends, is the subject of this essay. I am going to walk you through some of the greatest philosophical minds of the Islamic world, and show you how they not only impacted their brethren, but also the Western world.

The earliest influential philosopher that we currently know of is a man by the name of al-Kindi. Al-Kindi, the “Philosopher of the Arabs,” was credited with translating and synthesizing Greek philosophical works into Arabic. He also contributed to metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology.

## The Golden Age of Islamic Philosophy

The 9th and 12th centuries were known as the Golden Age for the Islamic World. During this age, Greek, Persian, and Indian philosophical traditions were fused together to form Islamic philosophy. 

## Al-Farabi, the “Second Teacher”

The first great philosopher we know of would be al-Farabi (c. 872–950), otherwise known as the “Second Teacher” to Aristotle. Like al-Kindi, al-Farabi synthesized Greek thought as well as Islamic thought.
