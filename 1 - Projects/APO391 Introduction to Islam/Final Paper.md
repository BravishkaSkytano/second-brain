> This paper will be about the great philosophers of the Islamic world and their contributions to the area of philosophy around the world.

When most of us think of philosophy, we picture people like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Kant, Confucius, Sun Tzu, Voltaire, and Locke. If you look up a list of famous philosophers, you will see many more Greeks, Europeans, and Chinese men who have made great contributions to the subject. Interestingly enough, one group of highly-populated people who you will not see on many lists happen to be the Muslims. Ask someone to name one Muslim philosopher and only the most studious of philosophers *might* mention Averroes, a Muslim born in Spain and known for his commentaries on Aristotle. Every major religion has their great philosophers, so where are the Muslim ones? That, my friends, is the subject of this essay. I am going to walk you through some of the greatest philosophical minds of the Islamic world, and show you how they not only impacted their brethren, but also the Western world.

The earliest influential philosopher that we currently know of is a man by the name of Al-Kindi. Al-Kindi, the “Philosopher of the Arabs,”

## Ramblings

I should probably start with the Golden Age of Islamic Philosophy during the 9th and 12th centuries. Then move on to list the actual philosophers and what they brought to the table.

Let’s see… we have Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes (Ibn Rushd). There’s also Abu Bakr al-Razi, al-Farabi, etc.
