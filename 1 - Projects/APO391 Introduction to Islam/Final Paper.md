> This paper will be about the great philosophers of the Islamic world and their contributions to the area of philosophy around the world.

When most of us think of philosophy, we picture people like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Kant, Confucius, Sun Tzu, Voltaire, and Locke. If you look up a list of famous philosophers, you will see many more Greeks, Europeans, and Chinese men who have made great contributions to the subject

## Ramblings

I should probably start with the Golden Age of Islamic Philosophy during the 9th and 12th centuries. Then move on to list the actual philosophers and what they brought to the table.

Let’s see… we have Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes (Ibn Rushd). There’s also Abu Bakr al-Razi, al-Farabi, etc.
