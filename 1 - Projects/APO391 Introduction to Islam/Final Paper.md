## Ramblings

I should probably start with the Golden Age of Islamic Philosophy during the 9th and 12th centuries. Then move on to list the actual philosophers and what they brought to the table.

Let’s see… we have Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes (Ibn Rushd). There’s also Abu Bakr al-Razi, al-Farabi, etc.
