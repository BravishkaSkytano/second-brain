## Introduction

When most of us think of philosophy, we picture people like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Kant, Confucius, Sun Tzu, Voltaire, and Locke. If you look up a list of famous philosophers, you will see many more Greeks, Europeans, and Chinese men who have made great contributions to the subject.[^1] Interestingly enough, one group of highly-populated people who you will not see on many lists happen to be the Muslims. Ask someone to name one Muslim philosopher and only the most studious of philosophers *might* mention Averroes, a Muslim born in Spain and known for his commentaries on Aristotle. Every major religion has their great philosophers, so, where are the Muslim ones? That, my friends, is the subject of this essay. I am going to walk you through some of the greatest philosophical minds of the Islamic world, and show you how they not only impacted their brethren, but also the Western world.

In the beginning, Islamic philosophy was simply Greek philosophy with a Muslim twist. As Daniel Brown put it, “In reality, they started not from scratch, but from Aristotle. Islamic philosophy is a direct import from Greek philosophy, and the Islamic philosophers saw themselves as simply building on the work of Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus.”[^2] It wasn’t until later in the … that some Persian and Indian philosophical traditions were added in. Islamic philosophers worked closely with Islamic theology and addressed themes such as the nature of God and the cosmos, the unity of God (Tawhid), the cultivation of moral character (akhlaq), and the nature and sources of knowledge.[^3]

## The Golden Age of Islamic Philosophy

During the eight to thirteenth centuries, the Golden Age for the Islamic World sparked philosophical thought among Muslim scholars, and birthed many of the great philosophers that we will discuss in this essay.

### Al-Kindi, the “Philosopher of the Arabs”

The earliest influential philosopher that we currently know of is a man by the name of al-Kindi. Al-Kindi, the “Philosopher of the Arabs,” was credited with translating and synthesizing Greek philosophical works into Arabic. He also contributed to metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology.

### Al-Farabi, the “Second Teacher”

The first great philosopher we know of would be al-Farabi (c. 872–950 AD), otherwise known as the “Second Teacher”, with Aristotle being the first. Like al-Kindi, al-Farabi synthesized Greek thought as well as Islamic thought. During his lifetime, al-Farabi also explored political philosophy, ethics, and metaphysics.
