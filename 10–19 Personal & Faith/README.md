> Focus: reflection, faith, emotional grounding, and gentle self-development.

### **10.01 Journal**

- Daily free-writing (“what happened / how I feel / what I need”).
- Occasional deeper reflections or “mental detox” sessions.
- Could also hold subfolders like “2025 Journal” if you want to group by year.

### **10.02 Mental Health**

- Emotional patterns, coping strategies, triggers, and reflections.
- Notes from research or videos on depression/anxiety management.
- Space for affirmations or comfort lists for rough days.

### **10.03 Faith & Bible Study**

- Your personal Bible study notes (themes, lessons, facts).
- Separate notes for sermon insights, prayers, or faith reflections.
- Maybe a “Scripture Index” to collect verses that resonate with you.

### **10.04 Health & Self-Care**

- Notes about nutrition, movement, and rest.
- Gentle exploration of self-care ideas (routines, sensory comforts, rest methods).
- Could include sections like “What helps when I feel low” or “New things to try.”

### **10.05 Personal Planning**

- A space to dream and orient your life direction without pressure.
- Short- and mid-term goals (weekly/monthly).
- Reflection on progress — not strict productivity, just awareness.

_(You could later move detailed goal planning to each area, like education, writing, etc., once your vault matures. This one stays broad and personal.)_
