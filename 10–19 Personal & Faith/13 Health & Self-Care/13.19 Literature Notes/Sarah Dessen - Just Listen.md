*To find the truth you’ve got to be willing to hear it.*

When she’s modeling, Annabel is the picture of perfection. But her real life is far from perfect. Fortunately, she’s got Owen. He’s intense, music-obsessed, and dedicated to always telling the truth. And most of all, he's determined to make Annabel happy. . .
## Notes

## Quotes


> [!quote] Annabel to Owen
> "I don't . . ." I said, then trailed off, not sure exactly how to put this. "I just don't like to hurt people. Or upset them. So sometimes, you know, I won't say exactly what I think, to spare them that."

> [!quote] Owen and Annabel
> “Now tell me what you really thought.” 
> “I told you. It was interesting.” 
> “Interesting,” he said, “is not a word.” 
> “Since when?” 
> “It’s a placeholder. Something you use when you don’t want to say something else.”

> [!quote] Annabel and Owen
> "It's just . . . I don't always say what I feel.” 
> "Why not?” 
> "Because the truth sometimes hurts," I said. 
> "Yeah," he said. "So do lies, though.”
