Key features of a Roman triumphal arch include:
- Two or three archways (passages)
- Decorative columns (often Corinthian)
- Reliefs depicting historical events or victories
- Inscriptions that record the name of the emperor, the event, and the date

One of the most famous examples is the Arch of Titus in Rome, built to honor Emperor Titus after his victory in the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE).
