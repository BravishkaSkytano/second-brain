> [!tldr] Fresco
> A **painting technique** where artists apply **water-based paint onto freshly laid wet plaster**, so the colors soak in and become part of the wall as it dries. This makes the artwork **long-lasting and vibrant**. Frescoes were commonly used for **murals** in churches and public buildings.
