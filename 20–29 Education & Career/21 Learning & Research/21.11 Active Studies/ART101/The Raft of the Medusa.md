## Description

**The Raft of the Medusa** is a monumental oil painting by French Romantic painter Théodore Géricault, created between 1818 and 1819. It depicts the aftermath of the 1816 shipwreck of the French naval frigate *Méduse*, which resulted in the deaths of most of those on a hastily built raft. The painting is notable for its dramatic portrayal of human suffering, its large scale, and its emotional intensity. Géricault conducted extensive research, including interviewing survivors and studying the dead, to ensure authenticity. The work was controversial at its 1819 debut but is now regarded as a seminal piece of the Romantic movement, influencing artists like Delacroix, Turner, and Courbet. It also reflects Géricault’s abolitionist views through the inclusion of Black figures in prominent roles.
