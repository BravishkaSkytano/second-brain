**Basic Information:**
- **Artist:** [[Jacques-Louis David]]
- **Date:** 1784-1785
- **Style:** [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]]
- **Current Location:** The Louvre, Paris
- **Significance:** One of the best-known paintings in Neoclassical style; became a defining image of pre-Revolutionary France

**The Story Depicted:**
- Based on a Roman legend from the 7th century BC about a dispute between Rome and Alba Longa
- Instead of full war, each city chooses three champions to fight
- Three Horatii brothers from Rome agree to fight three Curiatii brothers from Alba Longa
- The painting shows the brothers swearing an oath before their father, who holds out their swords
- Only one Horatii brother survives, but he defeats all three Curiatii by separating them

**Key Elements in the Painting:**
- **Left side:** Three Horatii brothers saluting their swords, showing no emotion
- **Center:** The father holding three swords, emotionless
- **Right side:** Three weeping women and two children
  - Camilla (in white): A Horatii sister betrothed to a Curiatii
  - Woman in brown: A Curiatii married to a Horatii
  - Both will lose loved ones regardless of outcome

**Themes & Symbolism:**
- **Patriotic duty over personal feelings** - men willing to sacrifice for the state
- **Gender contrast:** Resolute, taut men vs. tender, weeping women
- Reflects political tensions as French Revolution approached (painted 1784, Revolution 1789)
- Emphasizes loyalty to the state rather than family or church

**Historical Context:**
- Commissioned by King Louis XVI's assistant as an allegory about loyalty to the state/king
- David changed the agreed-upon scene to his own invention
- Ironically, David later voted for Louis XVI's execution during the Revolution
- Sources: Livy's *Ab Urbe Condita* and Dionysius's *Roman Antiquities*

**Artistic Technique:**
- Simple yet powerful use of tonal contrasts
- Clear compositional divisions between male/female, duty/emotion
- Neoclassical style emphasizing clarity and moral purpose

**Reception:**
- Immediate success with critics and public
- Even the Pope requested a viewing in Rome
- Initially displayed poorly at the 1785 Paris Salon, but public demand forced it to be moved to a prominent location
- Enhanced David's fame and allowed him to take on students
