The Hay Wain, painted by John Constable in 1821, is a renowned English painting depicting a rural scene on the River Stour between Suffolk and Essex. It is considered one of the quintessential works of the Romantic movement and is currently displayed at the National Gallery in London. 

The painting originally titled *Landscape: Noon* was not immediately successful but gained acclaim in France, where it received a gold medal from Charles X. It was later donated to the National Gallery by Henry Vaughan in 1886.

The painting is part of Constable's "six-footers" series and features a detailed, curated landscape with elements added for compositional appeal. It has also been the subject of modern protests, including by groups like Just Stop Oil.
