## Description

The **Rouen Cathedral** series, painted by **Claude Monet** in the **1890s**, consists of over thirty paintings capturing the façade of the cathedral at different times of day and year, emphasizing how **light** changes the appearance of the subject. Monet painted these works in **Rouen, Normandy**, and later reworked them in his studio. The series was well-received, with notable artists like **Camille Pissarro** and **Paul Cézanne** praising it. Monet used **thick, textured paint** to convey the dynamic interplay of **light and color**. The series was later displayed in various galleries, including the **Musée d'Orsay** and the **National Gallery in London**.
