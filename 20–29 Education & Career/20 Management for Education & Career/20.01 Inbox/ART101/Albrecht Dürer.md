Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a renowned German painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German [[Renaissance]], known for his woodcuts, engravings, and theoretical works on art and mathematics. Born in Nuremberg, he gained fame across Europe for his high-quality prints and was influenced by Italian artists like [[Raphael]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Dürer's work integrated [[Classical|classical]] motifs and humanist ideas, and he made significant contributions to the fields of cartography, astronomy, and the theory of art, leaving a lasting legacy on European art and culture.
