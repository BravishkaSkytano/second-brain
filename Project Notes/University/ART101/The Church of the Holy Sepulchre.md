The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, also known as the Church of the Resurrection, is a fourth-century church located in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and is considered the holiest site in Christianity. It is believed to encompass the traditional sites of Jesus Christ's crucifixion at Calvary (Golgotha) and his burial and resurrection in the empty tomb, with the tomb housed within a shrine called the Edicule. The original church was commissioned by Roman Emperor Constantine the Great and his mother, Helena, around AD 326, following the demolition of a temple to Aphrodite that had been built on the site by Emperor Hadrian. The church has undergone numerous reconstructions due to destruction by the Persians in 614, the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim in 1009, and subsequent rebuilding by Byzantine emperors and the Crusaders in the 12th century. The present structure, largely dating from a major restoration in 1810, reflects a blend of architectural styles including Paleochristian, Romanesque, and Gothic. The church is shared among several Christian denominations, including the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and Roman Catholic Churches, each controlling specific areas and conducting regular services
