Hellenistic definition

^79d00d

Hellenistic refers to the period in history and culture that followed the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, lasting until the Roman conquest of the Mediterranean, generally ending with the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC. It's characterized by a fusion of Greek traditions with those of the conquered regions, including Persia, Egypt, and parts of Asia. This cultural period also marks the spread of the Greek language, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca of the ancient world.

Hellenistic culture encompassed advancements in art, science, [[Definition of Philosophy|philosophy]], and technology, with notable developments in fields such as mathematics, physics, and literature. Blending Greek and Eastern influences led to new forms of art, religion, and philosophy, such as the syncretic worship of gods like Serapis and the emergence of philosophical schools like Stoicism and Epicureanism.

The term "Hellenistic" is derived from the Greek word Hellene, meaning "Greek," and the word itself was coined in the 19th century by historian Johann Gustav Droysen to describe the period of Greek cultural expansion beyond Greece. It's distinct from "Hellenic," which refers to Greece itself and its [[Classical|classical]] period, whereas "Hellenistic" refers to the broader cultural influence of Greek civilization across the ancient world.
