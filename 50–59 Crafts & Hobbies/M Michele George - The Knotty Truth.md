This is the first comprehensive manual that guides the professional and novice through the intricate process of installing, growing, maintaining and designing locks holistically at home or in the salon. You are getting a four part manual with almost 300 pages of detailed instructions on the care of dreadlocks. There are numerous charts, diagrams, schematics, instructions and pictures to guide anyone at any level in the artistry of dreadlocking. If there is one book to buy on the art of creating dreadlocks this is THE one; and, well worth the investment. Used by cosmetologists for training and in CEU instruction within the cosmetology industry.
