Health and self-care are two areas that I struggle with, especially when it comes to mental health. So much stems from the mind and emotions, so if you don't take care of those, your body, and your spirit will suffer.

> [!bible|no-title]
> ¹⁹ Don’t you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself, ²⁰ for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body. 
> ~ 1 Corinthians 6:19-20
